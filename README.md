# README 

"Text editor" I wrote for funzies - saves files with a .dan extention, 'cause ego. A better version of dan-text-editor project. Now ciphers files with Caesar Ciphers and can read them now. Script is far longer tho.

[This](https://github.com/Dangrainage/dan-text-editor) was the original project.

# HOW TO USE

To run It, just make a folder and put the danitor.sh into the folder, run `bash danitor.sh`, other instructions are included. Saving Is done by CTRL + D.

# HOW IT WORKS

It works by taking the users text and running It trough a caesar cipher, moving every character by 4 letters, and even wrapping when nessecary.
Doesn't cipher numbers and special characters tho.
The .dan file extention Is there 'cause I can basically, otherwise It's plaintext caesar cipher (can you tell It's my favorite cipher by now?).

# ANYWAYS FOLKS, ENJOY!!
